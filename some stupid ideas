Core:
- This project is meant to make you code a small program using termcaps which will allow you to pick from a list of choices and return it to your shell.


- how many columns wide it is
- what string to send to move the cursor to an arbitrary position (including how to encode the row and column numbers), 
- how to scroll the screen up one or several lines, and how much padding is needed for such a scrolling operation.

The termcap library is the application programmer's interface to the termcap data base. It contains functions for the following purposes::
- Finding the description of the user's terminal type (tgetent).
- Interrogating the description for information on various topics (tgetnum, tgetflag, tgetstr).
- Computing and performing padding (tputs).
- Encoding numeric parameters such as cursor positions into the terminal-specific form required for display commands (tparam, tgoto).

Compilation:
- `-ltermcap' or `-ltermlib'

Find the terminal in use:
 - tgetent

 Each piece of information recorded in a terminal description is called a capability. Each defined terminal capability has a two-letter code name and a specific meaning. 
 For example, the number of columns is named `co'.
  See section Definitions of the Terminal Capabilities, for definitions of all the standard capability names.
